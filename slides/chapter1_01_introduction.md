# Introduction

---

In this course, we'll be looking at a range of ways of accomplishing a task.  For any given task, you'll find very strong opinions and very different ways to do exactly the same thing. There are many different cultures of development out there. Would this project be best served by programming in Python or Go? React? Hugo? Should we create a web-app or a desktop application? Who do we priveledge and who do we exclude when we choose one approach over another? What are the relative costs, risks and opportunities?

In Digital Scholarship, we could try to "teach the debate" and show both sides. Every approach has its merits and problems. However, we find it's more helpful to teach our way of doing things in a way  that is grounded in our experience working with Haverford students.  Whenever possible we'll try to give you context on our approaches and the range of possible solutions and methods.  We've written our shared preferences down in a "style guide" for the DS program.  These preferences allow us to create more sustainable projects.  We use technologies that can be learned in a relatively short period of time.  We document our practices and use documentation to share new knowledge in the "DS cookbook."
