# Introduction

Welcome to summer 2020!  We're all virtual, all remote and doing what many web development companies have done for a long time.  This course is here to give you the skills and information that you'l need to complete your work this summer.  We'll mostly be working together in syncronous Zoom sessions, but there will be time for independent and group work to learn through practice.  We'll start out slow, make a mini-project and gradually get you up to speed on the projects you'll be developing this summer.  

We're all in the same boat during a storm. If you get sick, or need to help others, or need time to get outside tasks done, let's just keep in touch and keep lines of communication open.  You can expect empathy and care from all staff in the libraries and your fellow students. Please reach out when you face challenges.

# Our Meetings 

   Here is the [Zoom link](https://haverford.zoom.us/j/99791957176) that we will use for all of our sessions.  There is no password.  We'll send a Google calendar invitation for all of our sessions.  You can find the Zoom link in the location field of the invite.  Please plan to join the room a 2-3 minutes before the start time.  If you have a headset or earphones with a microphone, please use that rather than your system microphone.  Please keep your mic on unless there's something really noisy that you want to spare us.  An open mic helps us to stay in workshop mode and not feel like we're in a lecture.  Please talk whenever moved. We'd prefer that you keep video on, but recognize that you may need to turn it off for a variety of reasons. Creative uses of virtual backgrounds, virtual webcams and other hacking is greatly appreciated. [Here's a great tutorial for an open source virtual background using opencv and Tensorflow](https://elder.dev/posts/open-source-virtual-background/).
