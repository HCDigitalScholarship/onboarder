Visual Studio Code is currently one of the most popular code editor.  It's simple and handle most of what you'll need this summer.

From the makers of GitHub, Atom is very similar to VSCode and works great.

# PyCharm

PyCharm is a full-featured Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  It basically does everything. As a student, you can sign up for a [free educational license here](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students).
Like Photoshop, PyCharm can feel a bit daunting at times and takes time to learn.  It does everything, but you need to learn how it does everything.  Many professional developers swear by it.  Andy's classes in graduate school used it, so it's something worth knowing, even if it's not your go-to code editor for every project. 

Real Python has a [great guide on PyCharm](https://realpython.com/pycharm-guide/) for further info.

# Kite

Whatever code editor you're using, we recommend also installing [Kite](https://www.kite.com/).

Kite is kind a great tool for seeing how other people write their code. As you write, the co-pilot will display the documentation for whatever you're using and share examples of how other people use that library.  It's a great way to keep track of current best practices and the range of opinions on how best to use particular tools.

Developers are very picky about the look and style of their code.  One of the best ways to make your code less smelly is to use a code formatter.  [Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) is very good for this.  

The main problem with Black is that is does all the work for you.  If you're interested in learning and better understanding the [Python PEP8 Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), PyCharm has style auto-suggest.  You can also [use pylint in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting).
