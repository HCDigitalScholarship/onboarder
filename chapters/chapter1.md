<exercise id="2" title="Getting Started">

We'll be doing a lot of work this summer using the command line and code editors.  If you haven't worked on the Linux or Unix command-line before, please take an hour or so to complete this tutorial from Ubuntu.  I will give you the commands that you'll need to navigate the directory try, move and copy files.  We'll discuss other commands such as `scp`, `htop`, and others very soon.  Here is the [tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview).
