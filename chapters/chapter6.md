<exercise id="1" title="Introduction to Javascript">
Javascript is a scripting language originally designed to facilitate interactions between the user and a web page. It has since grown into a full client- and server-side scripting language, with web frameworks built entirely in Javascript like [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (including the framework for this application!).

The [Mozilla Javascript tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction) does a nice job of introducing Javascript and the kinds of things it can do, but there's a lot!

<exercise id="2" title="Frameworks and Libraries">
Fortunately, as is the case for many other tools we've discussed this week, some friendly folks have done a lot of heavy lifting for us already! There is a world of Javascript libraries and frameworks out there that make interactive sites and applications easier to build and more consistent in their construction. Some are designed for building simple applications, some for data visualizations, drawing, animation, etc. Here are a few examples:


- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/), although it has been for a while, is still an important tool in the web developer's toolkit. Its killer feature is a simplified way of interacting with and manipulating the DOM, which makes changes to web pages possible based on user interaction. It also makes CSS animations, event handling, and Ajax (asynchronous) calls simpler than if you were writing in pure Javascript.

- Application frameworks like [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [Angular](https://angular.io/) make it easier to quickly stand up web applications that work across mobile and desktop platforms. They both simplify the construction of interfaces, and have their own different strengths and weaknesses.

- [D3](https://d3js.org/) is a library that creates data visualizations in HTML, CSS, and SVG so that they can be viewed in web browsers. Here is [one example](http://qmh.haverford.edu/types-of-mental-illness#alluvialCausesTypes) of a D3 visualization in one of our projects.

- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) is a mapping library that creates interactive data-driven maps for desktop and mobile browsers. We've used Leaflet to create maps like [this one](https://booksofduchesses.com/#map) from the Books of Duchesses project.

The following is a creative coding exercise to help you become familiar with the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library.

- [P5 reference](https://p5js.org/reference/)
- Using the [p5.js editor](https://editor.p5js.org/) -- [Slides](https://aatishb.com/stc209/slides.html)
- [Robot Chicken exercise](https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/playingwithdata/raw/master/p5%20playing%20with%20data%20workshop%20handout.pdf)
- [Simple animation](https://editor.p5js.org/slcruz/sketches/b2uP4YSNu)
- [Plotting data](https://editor.p5js.org/slcruz/sketches/005jy4zME)
- [Stripes visualization](https://editor.p5js.org/slcruz/sketches/mCzhpwQ_7)

This section is based on the [P5.js workshop](https://github.com/Princeton-CDH/playingwithdata) at Princeton's Center for Digital Humanities. Many thanks to the Princeton CDH for sharing these materials and for organizing a remarkable workshop!
