<exercise id="8" title="Seek Strong Opinions">

There is a "right way to do things" genre in programming books.  They typically claim to have an optimal approach to x or y or z. I enjoy reading these books.  They're a great source of new ideas and a chance to test your own assumptions and practices.  Here are a few recent and notable titles in the genre of programming best practices: 

- [Test-Driven Development with Python: Obey the Testing Goat](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/)

- [Python Tricks: The Book, A Buffet of Awesome Python Features](https://realpython.com/products/python-tricks-book/)

- [Two Scoops of Django 3.x: Best Practices for the Django Web Framework](https://www.feldroy.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-3-x)

<exercise id="9" title="Contribute to the Conversation">

This is a hard one. It's very easy to think of yourself as a beginner and wait quietly until a time when you "really" "actually" know something.  The reality is that the more you know, the more you're aware of the range of things that you don't know (thanks Socrates!).  It's not going to get better.  Just dive into the conversation and start where you're are right now. You'll meet people who know more than you, they may even have a chip on their shoulder, but that's the only way to learn --to engage.  

- stackoverflow is a chaotic bus station full of people yelling.  People will bump into you.   People will yell at you.  It's like sidewalks in New York City. There's a culture of walking fast and seeming important.  It's still the best place to get answers to your questions (nearly all have been asked before), and try to help others. 

- Open source projects are a great way to meet people and give back.  All the software that we use comes from the voluntary contributions of ordinary people.  They're usually very nice and have great get-togethers. PyCon was virtual this year, so you can catch all the talks [here](https://us.pycon.org/2020/online/). [Here is a useful site on how to get started with open source contributions](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/). 

- The Django Community has some real characters and brilliant programmers.  We recommend that you try, if only for the summer, the Django community lists.  There is one for "how to" questions and one on the  development of the Django project.  You can join both [here](https://www.djangoproject.com/community/)
