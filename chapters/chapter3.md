<exercise id="1" title="Introduction">
XML is a markup language, which means it is a way to encode data. There are many standards for encoding data, but few are easily readable by both humans and machines. XML is just that! It's also a very portable data format, designed to navigate many different encoding standards.

Here's what we'll cover in this unit:

1. Learn the basics of XML and why it is useful
2. Markup a historic document
3. Learn about a specific encoding standard of XML: The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)
4. Digital Scholarship use cases for XML
