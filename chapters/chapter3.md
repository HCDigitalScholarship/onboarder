<exercise id="1" title="Introduction">
XML is a markup language, which means it is a way to encode data. There are many standards for encoding data, but few are easily readable by both humans and machines. XML is just that! It's also a very portable data format, designed to navigate many different encoding standards.

Here's what we'll cover in this unit:

1. Learn the basics of XML and why it is useful
2. Markup a historic document
3. Learn about a specific encoding standard of XML: The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)
4. Digital Scholarship use cases for XML

<exercise id="3" title="Activity: Markup a (sort of) Historical Manuscript">

Open <a href="https://jamboard.google.com/d/1RMA3MsW-MlvA0TJ1b7KWju3biuINxVOL-ezPXPlk2q4/edit?usp=sharing" target="blank">this Jam</a>.

Mark it up using colors and/or symbols, but be consistent across the entire document. Get creative with punctuation, symbols, and colors! Think about the different kinds of information you could encode into the document like formatting, named entities, dates, and other information.
